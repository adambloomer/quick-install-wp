Quick Install WP
================

A script for installing wordpress via terminal - grabs latest WP version plus a couple of my preferred plugins and the Starkers theme.
		
In the terminal navigate to the directory in which you wish to install Wordpress and run the following command:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambloomer/quick-install-wp/master/quick-install-wp | sh`

Give it a minute or so and you'll very quickly have a fresh new install of Wordpress ready for theming!
